# üó∫Ô∏è Sri Lanka National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) Layers

This repository provides **scripts and data downloads** from the official [Sri Lanka NSDI Geoportal](https://gisapps.nsdi.gov.lk/server/rest/services/Srilanka/All_Layers/MapServer), which hosts a collection of national GIS datasets.

## üìñ What is this about?

The **National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI)** in Sri Lanka is a central platform that provides access to government geospatial data.
This dataset collection includes administrative boundaries, land use, transportation networks, utilities, and more ‚Äî all in GIS-ready formats.

These layers are useful for:

* Researchers and students studying geography, environment, and urban planning.
* Developers building applications with Sri Lankan geospatial data.
* Government agencies and NGOs working with spatial analysis.
* Anyone curious about mapping Sri Lanka!

## üìÇ What‚Äôs in this repo?

* `download_layers.py` ‚Üí A Python script to automatically download **all available layers** from the NSDI MapServer in their original formats.
* `Release file` ‚Üí A compressed archive containing all layers.

## üîΩ Where does the data come from?

All data is sourced directly from:

üëâ [Sri Lanka NSDI Geoportal MapServer](https://gisapps.nsdi.gov.lk/server/rest/services/Srilanka/All_Layers/MapServer)

Hosted by the Survey Department of Sri Lanka.

## üöÄ How to use

### üîπ Option 1: Run locally

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/srilanka-nsdi-layers.git
   cd srilanka-nsdi-layers
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install requests
   ```

3. Run the script to download all layers:

   ```bash
   python download_layers.py
   ```

4. A folder named `SriLanka_Layers` will be created with all downloaded files, and a `SriLanka_Layers.zip` archive will also be generated.

* Some formats (like `.pbf`) are binary and require special GIS software (e.g., QGIS, ArcGIS Pro) to read.
* The data is maintained by the Survey Department. Availability and formats may change if the service updates.
* Please check usage rights/licensing with the **Survey Department of Sri Lanka** before using for commercial purposes.

## üåç Example Applications

* Visualizing Sri Lanka‚Äôs administrative divisions in **QGIS**.
* Building web maps using **Leaflet** or **MapLibre**.
* Performing geospatial analysis with **Python (GeoPandas, Shapely)**.
